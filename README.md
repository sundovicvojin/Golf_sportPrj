The sports organization Golf Club Serbia maintains records of all golf courses and players across the country. 
To support its activities, the club has developed a database that tracks players, courses, and completed matches.
To improve the existing application, new functionalities should be added, 
including the ability to remove courses that are no longer active and display matches played within a selected time frame. Additionally, 
for tournament purposes, the database should be expanded to include data on referee tracking based on completed matches. 
A desktop application should be developed to facilitate work with the existing database.
